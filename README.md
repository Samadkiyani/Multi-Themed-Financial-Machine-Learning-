Multi-Themed Financial Machine Learning
This is a Machine Learning project developed for financial data analysis, which includes multiple interactive themes for a more engaging experience. The project utilizes Streamlit for the web interface and provides features like data uploading, machine learning model training, and visualization of predictions.

Project Overview
The Multi-Themed Financial Machine Learning platform allows users to upload datasets, select target and feature variables, train machine learning models (Linear Regression or Random Forest), and evaluate the models through interactive visualizations. The platform comes with multiple dynamic themes to enhance user experience, including Zombie Apocalypse, Futuristic Voyage, Game of Kingdoms, and Pubg Battlefield.

Key Features:
Dynamic Data Upload and Preprocessing: Upload CSV or Excel files, select features and targets for analysis.

Interactive Themes: Various theme options like Zombie Apocalypse, Futuristic Voyage, etc., to make data analysis fun and engaging.

Machine Learning Model Training: Train models using Linear Regression or Random Forest and make predictions based on selected features.

Visualization: View feature-target relationships, correlation matrices, and model evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R².

Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated, and feature importance (for Random Forest) is displayed.

Usage
Upload your dataset in CSV or Excel format.

Select the target variable (the variable you want to predict) and features (input variables).

Choose between Linear Regression or Random Forest for training the model.

Visualize the performance of the model, including metrics like RMSE and R².

Explore the dataset's feature-target relationships and correlations using built-in visualizations.

Select different themes for an engaging data analysis experience.
